// Export components
export { default as ArchClip } from './components/ArchClip.js';

// ThemeToggle has been moved to the docs application.

// Export types if needed
// (Example: export type { ArchClipProps } from './components/ArchClip';)

// You might also want to export the CSS for consumers who don't use tree-shaking for CSS
// or if global styles associated with components are necessary.
// For now, component styles are in .module.css files and imported by components.
// If you had a global stylesheet for the library, you'd import it here:
// import './styles/main.css';
